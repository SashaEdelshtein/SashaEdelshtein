      <h3>Teplo Project</h3>
      <p>Teplo is a Moscow-based company seeking to solve problem with cold hands and feet during winter time in Russia, which key products are hand and feet warmers.</p>
      <p>The goal was to create a package which would be sold on ice rinks and parks as well as in hotels. Therefore, target audience is people, who spend their time outside during winter period.</p>
      <p>As most competitors are focused on sport theme, we decided to create a package that would both tell people about the product and graphically rhyme with entironment.</p>
